# Why do I name my projects so bad

Anyways, this is a basic implementation of web sockets in rust using 'socketioxide', a rust implementation of socket.io built on top of tower system.

## How do I use it?
The client is written in js and the server is in rust.

1. Start the rust server using `cargo run` in root dir
2. Start the client by installing dependencies first then run node client.js
3. Start typing

Star the projects before cloning them -_-
